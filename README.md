# Save coupons
Save coupons automatically!

## Suggestions
Tired of receipts longer than the toilet paper you just bought?

If you want more coupons and want to save the environment at the same time, I highly suggest signing up to [digital receipts](https://www.cvs.com/content/digital-receipt "CVS Digital Receipts") or [registering an account](https://www.walgreens.com/register/regOptions.jsp "Walgreens Accounts")!

By doing so, the coupons that typically print on your receipt will instead be sent to your email; from there you'll be able to send these coupons directly to your card. Once they're on your card, they'll be applied automatically when you check outâ€”no need to remember to bring them to the store and apply them yourself anymore!

## Installation
This script has a few dependencies that must be installed before use.

### Chromedriver
The easiest way to install this is with Homebrew. In a command line window, run `brew cask install chromedriver` and it will be automatically installed.

If you do not have Homebrew installed, follow the instructions on [its website](https://brew.sh/ "Homebrew").

### Splinter
To install the splinter library to Python, use pip by running `sudo pip install splinter`. You may have to enter your password.

## Use and Debugging
### <a name="use"></a>Running the Script
1. In a Terminal window, navigate to the folder in which the Python file is located (using `cd`).
2. Then, run the bash script with `./save_money.sh`. This script will automatically update your local repo with the latest code and start the Python script.
3. Follow the prompts.
4. Save money at the store!

### Debugging
If the bash script does not work, it may have failed on some intermediate step, or it might not have permissions to run.

If the issue is permissions:

1. Run `chmod u+x save_money.sh`
2. Try to run it again with the steps in [Running the Script](#use) above.

If the script fails on an intermediate step, run the steps manually to diagnose the issue:

1. Update the local repo with `git pull`.
2. Run the Python script with `python coupons.py`.
